// object oriented programming in c++
//object oriented programming is just an approch(ek "tareequa" ya phir "ek soach" hai )
//object oriented programming is an approach to create programms in a structural manner

//a class is a template to create objects. it traetes data as a critical element
// a class decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the objects...

//oops works on the concept on classes and objects 
// when we create a class it doesnt take up memory space,
//when we create the objects for the class, then the memory is utilised 


// classes -- basic template for creating objects
// objects -- basic runtime entities.
// data abstraction & encapsulation -- wrapping data and functions into single unit
// inheritance -- properties of one class can be inherited into others 
// polymorphism -- ability to take more than one forms
// dynamic binding -- code which will execute is not known until the program runs 
// message passing -- object.message(information) call format syntax
